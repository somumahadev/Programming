Attendance_System
1.	Array Usage: How does the program utilize arrays to store information about students and their attendance records?

2.	String Handling: In what scenarios does the program use string manipulation functions like strcpy and scanf for handling student names and dates?

3.	Function Usage: Can you identify the purpose of the addStudent, markAttendance, and generateReport functions in the program?

4.	Conditional Statements: How does the program use conditional statements, such as if and ternary operators, 
    to determine whether a student is present or absent and to display the attendance status in the report?

5.	Looping Constructs: Describe how the program utilizes loops, such as for loops and a do-while loop, 
    to repeatedly present the menu to the user and perform tasks based on their input.

6.	What is the purpose of the addStudent function in the program?

7.	How does the program store information about each student's name and roll number?

8.	What action does the program take when the user selects the option to mark attendance?

9.	How does the program handle the situation where the maximum limit of students has been reached?

10.	How does the program handle the case when the user inputs an invalid choice in the menu?

11.	When marking attendance, what information does the program require from the user?

12.	How does the program inform the user that attendance has been successfully marked for a student?

13.	What is the maximum number of students that can be added to the program?

14.	How does the program represent a student's attendance status?

15.	Can you explain how the program prompts the user to input a date in the format DD-MM-YYYY?

16.	What message does the program display when a student is successfully added?

17.	What happens if the user inputs a roll number that does not correspond to any student when marking attendance?

18.	Describe the information displayed in the attendance report generated by the program.

19.	How does the program handle the case when the user inputs an invalid choice in the menu?

20.	What modifications would you propose to the generateReport function to provide additional insights into student attendance, such as overall attendance percentage?
